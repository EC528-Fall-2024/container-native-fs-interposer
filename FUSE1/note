### Reason why using fuse_lowlevel.h instead of fuse.h
low level api is asynchronous while high level is synchronous. 
we need threading to do I/O throttling for later

Current working will only support single thread. which is just to really get familia with fuse_lowlevel.h 


1) initialize low_level filesystem operations ->> struct fuse_lowlevel_ops
2) initialize low level session. ->> fuse_session_new()
3) set up signal handler ->> fuse_set_signal_handlers(se)
4) session Mount File System ->> fuse_session_mount()
5) enter eventloop ->> fuse_session_loop()
6) session Umount fs ->> fuse_session_destroy(), fuse_session_exit()
